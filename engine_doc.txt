# The engine represents the game algorithm. It is responsible for computing the game tree using the minimax algorithm.
# After the game tree is computed, the engine will return it to pruning.py to be pruned using alpha-beta pruning.

# The game state is a matrix of strings representing the board. Each string is either "BLACK", "WHITE", "KING",
# or "EMPTY".

# To use the engine we create a heuristic function that takes a game state and returns a value of how valuable a move
# is. The lower the value, the better the move for WHITE. The higher the value, the better the move for BLACK.
# The heuristic function is the following:
#   - check KINGs surroundings, if the KING is in danger (surrounded by black pieces) we increase the score, if the
#   KING is close to the throne (more protected from captures) we decrease the score.
#   - check if the KING is at the edge of the board, if it is WHITE wins, and we set the score to -infinity.
#   - check if the KING is captured, if it is BLACK wins, and we set the score to +infinity.
#   - check the number of black pieces and white pieces on the board. We add and subtract the number of black and white
#   pieces from the score respectively. If there are fewer black pieces, we lower the score, if there are fewer white
#   pieces, we increase the score.

# After we computed the heuristic function, we use the minimax algorithm to compute the game tree and recursively find
# the best move for the current player. If we meet either of our base cases, we return the heuristic value of the game.
# Base cases:
#  - recursive depth limit reached
#  - the game is over (there is winner based on board layout)
# We start finding all the possible moves given the current game state.
# For each move we make it and given a new game state we call the minimax function recursively. The recursive call
# will return the heuristic value of the new game state. We then compare the heuristic value of the new game state
# with the heuristic value of the current game state. If the recursive value is the best we've seen so far, we update
# the best value and the best move.
# After we've checked all the possible moves, we return the best move and the best value.
